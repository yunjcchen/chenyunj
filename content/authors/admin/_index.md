Hello! I am currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Occupational Therapy at Chang Gung University in Taiwan. Prior to this role, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences at McMaster University in Canada.

My research interests lie at the intersection of occupational science/therapy, developmental psychopathology, and child psychiatry. I focus on the heterogeneous behavioral manifestations observed across the lifespan among children on the neurodevelopmental spectrum. I am particularly interested in applying advanced quantitative approaches to capture the complex and dynamic nature of typical and atypical development.

Grounded in the principles of developmental science (e.g., developmental variability and cascades) and occupational science (e.g., person–environment fit and transactional processes), my work aims to inform early identification and intervention strategies for autism and to improve life outcomes for autistic people and their families from diverse backgrounds.

M﻿y primary research topics:

1. Early sensory differences and development in transdiagnostic community samples of infants and children
2. Development and validation of parent-report screeners for early identification of autism 
3. Developmental variability of functional outcomes from early childhood to adolescence in autism 
4. Developmental dynamics of core symptoms, co-occurring health conditions, and functional impacts in autism
