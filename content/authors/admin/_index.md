Hello! I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Offord Centre for Child Studies](https://offordcentre.media-doc.ca/) at McMaster University and a member of the [McMaster Autism Research Team (MacART)](http://www.macautism.ca/welcome-macart).

With a background in occupational therapy, I have gained valuable experience working with individuals with special needs across different developmental stages and settings. Through my involvement in longitudinal projects with clinical and general populations, I have developed a strong interest in understanding the diverse behavioral manifestations observed throughout the lifespan within and beyond the autism spectrum.

I am passionate about utilizing methodology and concepts rooted in developmental science, such as developmental variability and cascades, as well as principles from occupational science, such as person-environment fit and transactions. Through these approaches, my aim is to contribute to the advancement of early detection and intervention strategies while striving to improve the overall life outcomes of individuals on the autism spectrum.

M﻿y primary research topics:

1. Early sensory differences and development in transdiagnostic community samples of infants and children
2. Development and validation of parent-report screeners for early identification of autism 
3. Developmental variability of functional outcomes from early childhood to adolescence in autism 
4. Developmental dynamics of core symptoms, co-occurring health conditions, and functional impacts in autism
