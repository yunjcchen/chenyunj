abstract: "Recent advances in longitudinal methodologies for observational
  studies have contributed to a better understanding of Autism as a
  neurodevelopmental condition characterized by within-person and between-person
  variability over time across behavioral domains. However, this finer-grained
  approach to the study of developmental variability has yet to be applied to
  Autism intervention science. The widely adopted experimental designs in the
  field—randomized control trials and quasi-experimental designs—hold value for
  inferring treatment effects; at the same time, they are limited in
  elucidating *what* works for *whom, why*, and *when*, given the idiosyncrasies
  of neurodevelopmental disorders where predictors and outcomes are often
  dynamic in nature. This perspective paper aims to serve as a primer for Autism
  intervention scientists to rethink the way we approach predictors of treatment
  response and treatment-related change using a dynamic lens. We discuss several
  empirical gaps, and potential methodological challenges and opportunities
  pertaining to: (1) capturing finer-grained treatment effects in specific
  behavioral domains as indexed by micro-level within-person changes during and
  beyond intervention; and (2) examining and modeling dynamic prediction of
  treatment response. Addressing these issues can contribute to enhanced study
  designs and methodologies that generate evidence to inform the development of
  more personalized interventions and stepped care approaches for individuals on
  the heterogeneous spectrum of Autism with changing needs across development."
