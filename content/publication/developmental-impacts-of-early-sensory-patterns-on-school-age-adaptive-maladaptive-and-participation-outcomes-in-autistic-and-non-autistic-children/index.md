abstract: Early sensory differences may cascade into later social-communication
  difficulties in autism, yet their impacts on broader functional outcomes have
  remained understudied. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive
  investigation into the longitudinal impacts of sensory patterns, including
  sensory hyperresponsiveness, hyporesponsiveness, and sensory
  repetitions/seeking behavior, on various school-age outcome domains among a
  community sample of children with autistic and non-autistic conditions. We
  prospectively followed 1,517 children with caregiver-reported sensory
  questionnaires across three timepoints from infancy to school age. A subsample
  (n = 389; 88 with reported autism diagnosis/concerns) was further assessed
  with adaptive, maladaptive and participation outcome measures at age 6–7.
  Structural equation modeling approaches were used to evaluate the multivariate
  associations between latent growth parameters (i.e., intercepts and slopes) of
  sensory patterns and school-age outcomes. Increasing sensory
  hyperresponsiveness was directly associated with poorer adaptive/maladaptive
  outcomes and indirectly with lower participation in activities with higher
  functional demands across settings at school age. Elevated sensory
  hyporesponsiveness was associated with lower adaptive functioning, more
  externalizing problems, and lower classroom participation. Trajectories of
  sensory patterns accounted for more unique variances in adaptive functioning
  and participation in daily life settings with higher functional and
  environmental demands among autistic children compared to their non-autistic
  peers.
