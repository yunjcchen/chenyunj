abstract: Aberrant attention patterns have been commonly reported in autistic
  children. However, few studies have examined attention to non-social stimuli
  varying in salience and complexity using eye-tracking technology, as well as
  their links to clinical sensory features. Forty-one children [16 with autism
  spectrum disorder (ASD), 10 with developmental delay (DD), and 15 neurotypical
  (NT)] ages 4 to 13 years were included in this cross-sectional study. Children
  completed a passive-viewing eye-tracking task designed to measure visual
  attention (e.g., fixation duration and count) to non-social stimuli with
  sensory qualities involving motion (spinning or non-spinning) and sound.
  Parents completed a clinical questionnaire about their childâ€™s sensory
  behaviors. Eye-tracking metrics were compared across stimulus conditions and
  diagnostic groups, and their associations with parent-report sensory features
  were examined. Overall children showed longer fixation durations and fewer
  fixation counts to more complex stimuli (e.g., moving or spinning objects),
  but such facilitatory effects of stimulus properties tended to be less evident
  in DD versus ASD or NT groups. More clinical sensory features, especially
  hyperresponsiveness, were moderately to highly associated with quicker initial
  fixations and longer fixation durations across stimulus conditions in ASD, but
  not in DD and NT groups. The overall attention and initial orientation to
  non-social stimuli were comparable across autistic children and their
  non-autistic peers, with some sensory properties such as dynamic motion
  producing a facilitatory effect (i.e., fewer fixations of longer durations) on
  attention. However, sensory differences, particularly hyperresponsiveness,
  might underlie attention patterns as impacted by stimulus properties
  specifically in autism.
