abstract: Participation in daily activities is often linked to functional
  independence and well-being, yet individual variability in participation and
  factors associated with that variation have rarely been examined among
  autistic youth. We applied latent profile analysis to identify subgroups of
  youth based on parent-reported activity participation frequency at home,
  school, and community, as well as associations with youth characteristics,
  family demographics, and environmental supportiveness among 158 autistic youth
  (ages 11-14 years at baseline). Three-, three- and two-profile solutions were
  selected respectively for home, school, and community settings; the most
  prevalent profiles were characterized by frequent home participation (73%),
  low participation in non-classroom activities at school (65%), and low
  community participation, particularly in social gatherings (80%), indicating
  participation imbalance across settings. More active participation profiles
  were generally associated with greater environmental support, higher cognitive
  and adaptive functioning, and less externalizing behaviour. Latent transition
  analysis revealed overall 75% stability in profile membership over
  approximately one year, with a different home participation profile emerging
  at the second time-point. Our findings highlighted the variable participation
  patterns among autistic youth as associated with individual, family, and
  environmental factors, thus stressing the need for optimizing
  person-environment fit through tailored supports to promote autistic youthâ€™s
  participation across settings.
