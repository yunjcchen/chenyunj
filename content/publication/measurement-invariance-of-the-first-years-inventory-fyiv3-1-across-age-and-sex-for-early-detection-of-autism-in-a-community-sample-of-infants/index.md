abstract: The use of parent-report screeners for early detection of autism is
  time- and cost-efficient in clinical settings but their utility may vary by
  respondent characteristics. This study aimed to examine the degree to which
  infants’ age and sex impacted parental reports of early behavioral signs of
  autism captured by the First Years Inventory Version 3.1 (FYIv3.1). The
  current sample included 6,454 caregivers of infants aged 6 to 16 months
  recruited through the North Carolina vital records. Using moderated nonlinear
  factor analysis for each of the seven FYIv3.1, we identified differential item
  functioning in small to medium effect sizes across 18 out of 69 items, with
  the majority of biases associated with infants’ age (e.g., object mouthing,
  walking, pretend, and imitation), while sex-related biases were minimal. This
  indicates that differential scoring algorithms by infants’ age and more
  closely spaced monitoring may be needed for these constructs for more accurate
  identification of autism in infancy.
