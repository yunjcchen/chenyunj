abstract: "Sensory-based subtypes among autistic children have been well
  documented, but little is known about longitudinal sensory subtypes beyond
  autistic populations. This prospective study aimed to identify subtypes based
  on trajectories of parent-reported sensory features measured at 6-19 months,
  3-4, and 6-7 years of age among a community-based birth cohort (N=1,517), and
  to examine their associations with school-age clinical and
  adaptive/maladaptive outcomes on a subset sample (N=389). Latent class growth
  analysis revealed five trajectory subtypes varying in intensity and change
  rates across three sensory domains. In contrast to an Adaptive-All Improving
  subtype (35%) with very low sensory features and overall better school-age
  outcomes, an Elevated-All Worsening subtype (3%), comprised of more boys and
  children of parents with less education, was associated with most elevated
  autistic traits and poorest adaptive/maladaptive outcomes. Three other
  subtypes (62% in total) were generally characterized by stable or improving
  patterns of sensory features at mild to moderate levels, and challenges in
  certain outcome domains. Our findings indicate that characterizing children
  based on early sensory trajectories may contribute to earlier detection of
  subgroups of children with sensory challenges who are more likely to
  experience developmental challenges by school age, followed by early targeted
  interventions for improved long-term outcomes. "
