abstract: Assessing autistic traits alongside co-occurring emotional/behavioral
  concerns (EBCs) is challenging due to their overlap in clinical presentations,
  which can vary by age and sex. This study aimed to investigate domain-specific
  associations between autistic traits and EBCs–including anxiety, affective,
  attention-deficit/hyperactivity, and oppositional-defiant problems–across
  childhood in autistic boys and girls. We prospectively followed 389 children
  (84% male) diagnosed with autism at ages 2–5 years, using the Social
  Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) across eight
  timepoints until age 12. Moderated nonlinear factor analysis was used to
  identify and adjust for measurement non-invariance of SRS items by age, sex,
  and EBCs. The adjusted scores were then used for sex-moderated time-varying
  modeling of associations between autistic traits and EBCs. Several SRS items
  in the domains of social-interaction difficulties and repetitive mannerisms
  showed significant intercept bias by age and level of co-occurring anxiety and
  ADHD (effect size r > 0.20). In autistic boys, strong associations were
  observed between social-communication difficulties and EBCs around ages 7–9,
  which tended to diminish in late childhood. In contrast, autistic girls showed
  stable or intensifying associations, particularly with anxiety, into late
  childhood. Results revealed significant associations between autistic traits
  and EBCs after addressing item-level measurement biases. The varying
  associations over time highlight the importance of continuous monitoring to
  promptly address autistic children's sex-differential mental health needs.
  These findings emphasize the benefits of refining behavioral constructs and
  adopting a nuanced developmental approach to identify critical periods of
  symptom coupling/decoupling for informing evaluation and service provision.
