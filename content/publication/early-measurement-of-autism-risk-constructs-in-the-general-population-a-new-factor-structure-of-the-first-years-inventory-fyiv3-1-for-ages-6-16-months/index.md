abstract: "Early detection of autism risk in the community is critical to
  increasing families' access to early intervention, yet few measures have been
  developed and tested for the general population of infants <16 months to tap a
  broader range of autism risk constructs. This study aimed to (a) examine the
  factor structure of the First Years Inventory, version 3.1 (FYIv3.1), with a
  sample of 6454 infants 6–16 months, and (b) determine the ability of the
  resulting factors to discriminate clinical outcome groups at 3 years of age.
  The FYIv3.1 is a parent-report tool designed to detect early behavioral risk
  signs that may be associated with a later diagnosis of ASD and related
  neurodevelopmental conditions. Factor analytic models were used to determine
  the number of constructs and inter-factor correlations. Findings supported a
  seven-factor structure: communication, imitation and play (CIP); social
  attention and affective engagement (SAE); sensory hyperresponsiveness (HYPER);
  sensory hyporesponsiveness (HYPO); self-regulation in daily routines (SREG);
  sensory interests, repetitions, and seeking behaviors (SIRS); motor
  coordination and milestones (MCM). Mean comparisons on these factors
  demonstrated significant discrimination of the three outcome groups at age
  3 years including those classified as having an ASD diagnosis and/or high
  autism symptoms, those classified as having other developmental
  disorders/conditions/concerns, and those classified with no known
  conditions/concerns. These findings support the validity and
  multidimensionality of early ASD risk constructs, as well as the potential use
  of the FYIv3.1 for phenotypic subtyping in the general population, and early
  detection in a broader age range of 6–16 months in future clinical studies."
