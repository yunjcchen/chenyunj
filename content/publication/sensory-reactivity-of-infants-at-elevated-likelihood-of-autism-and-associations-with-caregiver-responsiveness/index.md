abstract: Infants at elevated likelihood of developing autism display
  differences in sensory reactivity, especially hyporeactivity, as early as 7
  months of age, potentially contributing to a developmental cascade of autism
  symptoms. Caregiver responsiveness, which has been linked to positive social
  communication outcomes, has not been adequately examined with regard to infant
  sensory reactivity. This study examined the multiplicative impact of infant
  sensory hypo- and hyperreactivity on caregiver responsiveness to sensory
  reactivity and regulation cues in 43 infants at elevated likelihood of autism.
  Sensory hyperreactivity was found to moderate the association between sensory
  hyporeactivity and caregiver responsiveness, such that caregivers of infants
  with moderately high sensory hypo- and hyperreactivity demonstrated higher
  responsiveness.
