abstract: This prospective study examined the latent growth trajectories of
  sensory patterns among a North Carolina birth cohort (N = 1517; 49% boys, 87%
  White) across infancy (6–19 months), preschool (3–4 years), and school years
  (6–7 years). Change rates of sensory hyper- and hyporesponsiveness better
  differentiated children with an autism diagnosis or elevated autistic traits
  from those with other developmental conditions, including non-autistic
  children with sensory differences. More sensory hyper- and hyporesponsiveness
  at infancy followed by steeper increases differentially predicted more
  autistic traits at school age. Further, children of parents with higher
  education tended to show stable or improving trajectories. These findings
  highlight the importance of tracking sensory patterns from infancy for
  facilitating early identification of associated challenges and tailored
  support for families.
